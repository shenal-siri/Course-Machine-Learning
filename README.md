# Course-Machine-Learning
Exercises and projects completed as part of Andrew Ng's brilliant [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera.

This course introduces foundational Machine Learning concepts from a mathematical perspective. These concepts are then translated from theory to practice through MATLAB-based projects. By implementing visualizations, machine learning systems and neural networks from the ground up, the course provides a base which can be developed further through the multitude of modern ML and Data Science frameworks available.
